# React Native FlatList Asynchronous Data Fetching Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native applications involving asynchronous data fetching within a `FlatList` component. The issue arises when the `renderItem` method of `FlatList` attempts to access data before the asynchronous operation (e.g., a network request) has completed, resulting in undefined values and potential crashes.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version demonstrating how to handle asynchronous data loading correctly within the `FlatList` component, preventing crashes and rendering consistent UI.  This solution uses conditional rendering to display a loading indicator or an empty state while data is still being fetched.
